            What is TacoBot?
            TacoBot is a gratitude sharing platform. Think Reddit silver or gold but instead give your friends tacos. TacoBot uses a fictional emoji currency (the taco emoji ðŸŒ® - :taco:) that you can use to show your gratitude to other community members. The supply of tacos is limited to 4 tacos daily, so share wisely.
            
            How do I send tacos?
            Sending tacos is easy. Just send a message in a text channel that includes those individual's names (ex. '@tacobot) and include the number of tacos (ðŸŒ®) you wish to send them.

            The Gameification of Gratitude
            Compete with your fellow community members, view your servers "/toptacos" to see who has the most tacos.

            Commands
            toptacos - Displays the servers taco leaders
            mytacos - Displays my tacos
            tacohelp - Shows this help context window
            `);
        }
    });
