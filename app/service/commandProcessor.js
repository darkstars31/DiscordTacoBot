            ${bold("What is TacoBot?")}
            TacoBot is a gratitude sharing platform. Think Reddit silver or gold but instead give your friends tacos. TacoBot uses a fictional emoji currency (the taco emoji ðŸŒ®) that you can use to show your gratitude to other community members. The supply of tacos is limited to 4 tacos daily, so share wisely.
            
            ${bold("How do I send tacos?")}
            Sending tacos is easy. Just send a message in a text channel that includes those individual's names (ex. '@tacobot) and include the number of tacos (ðŸŒ®) you wish to send them.

            ${bold("The Gameification of Gratitude")}
            Compete with your fellow community members, view your servers "/toptacos" to see who has the most tacos.
